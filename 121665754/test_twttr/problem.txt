Testing my twttr
In a file called twttr.py, reimplement Setting up my twttr from Problem Set 2, restructuring your code per the below, wherein shorten expects a str as input and returns that same str but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

def main():
    ...


def shorten(word):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Then, in a file called test_twttr.py, implement one or more functions that collectively test your implementation of shorten thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_twttr.py
Hints
Be sure to include
import twttr
or

from twttr import shorten
atop test_twttr.py so that you can call shorten in your tests.

Take care to return, not print, a str in shorten. Only main should call print.
