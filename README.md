# cs50P
I have to say that i really enjoyed every lecture of CS50P and i am willing to take more classes to expand my knowlege 😊👩🏻‍💻⚙️🔎
(Solutions and problem sets of each CS50P week are located inside the directory, in each problem set's folder there are one or two .py files with the solution and a txt file with the problem set)
